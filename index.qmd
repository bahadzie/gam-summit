The [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and regional organizations are supporting the development and use of analytics tools for epidemic preparedness and response. Powered by [Data.org](https://data.org/), the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/) project has made substantial progress towards producing analytics tools aimed at addressing the most critical questions during epidemics. Currently, up to **six (6)** [Epiverse-TRACE packages](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/etstats/articles/cran-statistics.html) are available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), with nearly **twenty (20)** more under active development. This reflects the results of two years of joint efforts between team members and our user communities.

These tools are developed across four institutions: the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/), the [Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at LSHTM (MRCG)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-gambia), and [Universidad de los Andes (UniAndes)](https://uniandes.edu.co/) and [Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (Javeriana)](https://javeriana.edu.co) in Colombia. These institutions span three countries—the UK, The Gambia, and Colombia—across three continents. 


The third Epiverse-TRACE annual summit will be held at the MRC Unit in The Gambia from __November 2 to 6, 2024__, under the theme: [**Strengthening Inclusive and Sustainable Tools for Epidemic Preparedness**]{style="color:blue;"}. This summit provides an opportunity to discuss progress, evaluate deliverables, and plan future activities.

Organizing committees from the Epiverse team have developed the summit's program to ensure the event's success. This includes a pre-summit training session happening the week before the summit. The training will be conducted by our team of research fellows, supported by Research Software Engineers (RSEs). Participants will learn how to use our tools within an outbreak analysis workflow.

The first Epiverse-TRACE summit was held in London, UK, between the 12th and 14th of December 2022. The event was organised in a form of a workshop around a central question: **“What should the first 100 lines of code written during new epidemics look like?”**. Together with groups working on processing and analysis pipelines, the organisations working on the front line response and generating data looked into the challenges around building efficient and centralised analysis pipelines. The main topics included:

1.  *Sharing experiences of outbreak responses*,
2.  *Identifying the challenges and questions during outbreaks*,
3.  *Building collaboration and pipelines*.

The details of the outcomes from these three days discussions are summarised in this [blogpost](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/100days-workshop/index.html).

Our second summit was organized in **Bogota, Colombia**, between the 26th and 29th of June 2023. The participants were given the opportunity to bring their thoughts on the following topics:

1.  *Collaborative Software Development*,
2.  *Building a community of users*,
3.  *Building RSE & Data Science teams*,
4.  *TRACE in the Global Perspective*.

The outcomes from these fruitful discussions are summarised in the [report](https://zenodo.org/records/10932686) published by the TRACE-LAC team in Colombia.
