## Workshop content

### Day 1

- Why use R packages for epidemic analytics?
- How to import data into the R environment?
- How to manipulate data in R?
- How to perform visualization in R?

### Day 2

- How to clean and standardize case data?
- How to aggregate and visualize case data?
- How can I ensure the above tasks are performed in an efficient and reproducible way?


### Day 3
- How do I simulate disease spread using a mathematical model?
- How do I investigate the effect of interventions on disease trajectories?
- How can we simulate transmission chains based on infection characteristics?

### Day 4

- What are the delay distributions and what is their usage on outbreak analytics?
- How to access delay distributions from a literature search database?
- How can I estimate key transmission metrics from a time series of case data?
- How do I account for incomplete reporting in forecasts?

### Day 5
- How to estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) and adjust for common biases?
- How can we estimate individual-level variation in transmission (i.e. superspreading potential)?
