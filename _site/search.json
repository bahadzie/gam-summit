    "text": "Powered by Data.org, the Epiverse-TRACE project has made substantial progress towards producing analytics tools aimed at addressing the most critical questions during epidemics. Currently, up to six (6) Epiverse-TRACE packages are available on CRAN, with nearly twenty (20) more under active development. This reflects the results of two years of joint efforts between team members and our user communities.\nEvery year, the Epiverse-TRACE team members, along with invited stakeholders from WHO, Data.org, and various healthcare organizations, convene to discuss progress, evaluate deliverables, and plan future activities. The third Epiverse-TRACE annual summit will be held at the MRC Unit in Banjul, The Gambia from November 2 to 6, 2024, under the theme: Strenthening sustainable and inclusive analytics ecosystem for epidemic preparedness. This summit provides an opportunity to discuss progress, evaluate deliverables, and plan future activities.\nOrganizing committees from the Epiverse team have developed the summit’s program to ensure the event’s success. This includes a pre-summit training session happening the week before the summit. The training will be conducted by our team of research fellows, supported by Research Software Engineers (RSEs). Participants will learn how to use our tools within an outbreak analysis workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second Epiverse-TRACE summit was held in Bogota, Colombia, between the 26th and 29th of June 2023. The participants were given the opportunity to bring their thoughts on the following topics:\n\nCollaborative Software Development,\nBuilding a community of users,\nBuilding RSE & Data Science teams,\nTRACE in the Global Perspective.\n\nThe outcomes from these fruitful discussions are summarised in the report published by the TRACE-LAC team in Colombia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first Epiverse-TRACE summit was held in London, UK, between the 12th and 14th of December 2022. The event was organised in a form of a workshop around a central question: “What should the first 100 lines of code written during new epidemics look like?”. Together with groups working on processing and analysis pipelines, the organisations working on the front line response and generating data looked into the challenges around building efficient and centralised analysis pipelines. The main topics included:\n\nSharing experiences of outbreak responses,\nIdentifying the challenges and questions during outbreaks,\nBuilding collaboration and pipelines.\n\nThe details of the outcomes from these three days discussions are summarised in this blogpost."
